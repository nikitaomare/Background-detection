Content based Image Retrieval

Content Based Image Retrieval is the current project that I am working on. It is for the solution for recognizing merchandise displayed on the shelves of a supermarket. The aim is to identify given images of individual products, which are taken under ideal illumination from the images of shelves of a supermarket.   Several algorithms are being used including significant template matching the query image with the shelve image and get the correlation coefficient and another by blank space detection using clustering of the image by extracting features like SURF, SIFT. This may increase the correlation coefficient of the correct product. Right now, I am working to find the blank spaces using clustering and extracting local features of an image.
